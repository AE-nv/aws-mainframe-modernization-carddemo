# US-035: Concurrent Session Management

**As a** user
**I want** to be able to have multiple sessions from different devices or locations
**So that** my work is not interrupted on other devices if one session times out

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each session has independent timeout and activity tracking
- Timeout or logout in one session does not affect others
- User can continue working in active sessions
