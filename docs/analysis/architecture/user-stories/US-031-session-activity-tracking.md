# US-031: Session Activity Tracking

**As a** user
**I want** the system to track my activity during my session
**So that** my session remains active while I am working

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Any user interaction resets inactivity timer
- Session metadata is updated with last activity timestamp
- Activity tracking works across all open tabs
