# US-036: Audit and Compliance Logging

**As a** system administrator
**I want** all session lifecycle events to be logged
**So that** we meet security and compliance requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Session creation, activity, timeout, and termination events are logged
- Logs include user ID, timestamps, and session details
- Logs are retained per compliance policy
